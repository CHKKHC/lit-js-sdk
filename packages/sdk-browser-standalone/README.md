This package is simply the browser build of the Lit-JS-SDK with all dependencies included. No bundling needed, you can drop this into a script tag on a webpage and it will work.

Importing this package is the same as importing the web Lit-JS-SDK package web build (`import LitJsSdk from 'lit-js-sdk/build/index.web.js'`) except this package has less extra stuff you don't need.
