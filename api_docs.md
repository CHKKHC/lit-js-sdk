## Welcome

Welcome to the LIT JS SDK API documentation.  To understand how these functions fit together, please view the README in the github repo for this SDK, located at [https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/lit-js-sdk/blob/main/README.md][95]

## mintLIT

This function mints a LIT using our pre-deployed token contracts.  You may use our contracts, or you may supply your own.  Our contracts are ERC1155 tokens on Polygon and Ethereum.  Using these contracts is the easiest way to get started.

### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][96]** 

    *   `params.chain` **[string][97]** The chain to mint on.  "ethereum" and "polygon" are currently supported.
    *   `params.quantity` **[number][98]** The number of tokens to mint.  Note that these will be fungible, so they will not have serial numbers.

Returns **[Object][96]** The txHash, tokenId, tokenAddress, mintingAddress, and authSig.

## LitNodeClient

A LIT node client.  Connects directly to the LIT nodes to store and retrieve encryption keys and signing requests.  Only holders of an NFT that corresponds with a LIT may store and retrieve the keys.

### Parameters

*   `config` **[Object][96]** 

    *   `config.alertWhenUnauthorized` **[boolean][99]** Whether or not to show a JS alert() when a user tries to unlock a LIT but is unauthorized.  An exception will also be thrown regardless of this option. (optional, default `true`)
    *   `config.minNodeCount` **[number][98]** The minimum number of nodes that must be connected for the LitNodeClient to be ready to use. (optional, default `6`)

### getSignedChainDataToken

Request a signed JWT of any solidity function call from the LIT network.  There are no prerequisites for this function.  You should use this function if you need to transmit information across chains, or from a blockchain to a centralized DB or server.  The signature of the returned JWT verifies that the response is genuine.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][96]** 

    *   `params.callRequests` **[Array][100]<[CallRequest][101]>** The call requests to make.  The responses will be signed and returned.
    *   `params.chain` **[string][97]** The chain name of the chain that this contract is deployed on.  See LIT_CHAINS for currently supported chains.

Returns **[Object][96]** A signed JWT that proves the response to the function call is genuine. You may present this to a smart contract, or a server for authorization, and it can be verified using the verifyJwt function.

### getSignedToken

Request a signed JWT from the LIT network.  Before calling this function, you must either create or know of a resource id and access control conditions for the item you wish to gain authorization for.  You can create an access control condition using the saveSigningCondition function.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][96]** 

    *   `params.accessControlConditions` **[Array][100]<[AccessControlCondition][102]>** The access control conditions that the user must meet to obtain this signed token.  This could be posession of an NFT, for example.  You must pass either accessControlConditions or evmContractConditions or solRpcConditions.
    *   `params.evmContractConditions` **[Array][100]<[EVMContractCondition][103]>** EVM Smart Contract access control conditions that the user must meet to obtain this signed token.  This could be posession of an NFT, for example.  This is different than accessControlConditions because accessControlConditions only supports a limited number of contract calls.  evmContractConditions supports any contract call.  You must pass either accessControlConditions or evmContractConditions solRpcConditions.
    *   `params.solRpcConditions` **[Array][100]<[SolRpcCondition][104]>** Solana RPC call conditions that the user must meet to obtain this signed token.  This could be posession of an NFT, for example.

    *   `params.resourceId` **[ResourceId][106]** The resourceId representing something on the web via a URL

Returns **[Object][96]** A signed JWT that proves you meet the access control conditions for the given resource id.  You may present this to a server for authorization, and the server can verify it using the verifyJwt function.

### saveSigningCondition

Associated access control conditions with a resource on the web.  After calling this function, users may use the getSignedToken function to request a signed JWT from the LIT network.  This JWT proves that the user meets the access control conditions, and is authorized to access the resource you specified in the resourceId parameter of the saveSigningCondition function.

Returns **[boolean][99]** Success

### getEncryptionKey

Retrieve the symmetric encryption key from the LIT nodes.  Note that this will only work if the current user meets the access control conditions specified when the data was encrypted.

Connect to the LIT nodes.

Returns **[Promise][108]** A promise that resolves when the nodes are connected.

## unlockLitWithKey

Manually unlock a LIT with a symmetric key.  You can obtain this key by calling "checkAndSignAuthMessage" to get an authSig, then calling "LitNodeClient.getEncryptionKey" to get the key.  If you want to see an example, check out the implementation of "toggleLock" which does all those operations and then calls this function at the end (unlockLitWithKey)

## verifyJwt

Verify a JWT from the LIT network.  Use this for auth on your server.  For some background, users can define resources (URLs) for authorization via on-chain conditions using the saveSigningCondition function.  Other users can then request a signed JWT proving that their ETH account meets those on-chain conditions using the getSignedToken function.  Then, servers can verify that JWT using this function.  A successful verification proves that the user meets the on-chain conditions defined in the saveSigningCondition step.  For example, the on-chain condition could be posession of a specific NFT.

## EVMContractCondition

Type: [Object][96]

### Properties

*   `contractAddress` **[string][97]** The address of the contract that will be queried
*   `chain` **[string][97]** The chain name of the chain that this contract is deployed on.  See LIT_CHAINS for currently supported chains.
*   `functionName` **[string][97]** The smart contract function to call
*   `functionParams` **[Array][100]** The parameters to use when calling the smart contract.  You can use the special ":userAddress" parameter which will be replaced with the requesting user's wallet address, verified via message signature
*   `functionAbi` **[Object][96]** The ABI of the smart contract function to call.  This is used to encode the function parameters and decode the return value of the function.  Do not pass the entire contract ABI here.  Instead, find the function you want to call in the contract ABI and pass that function's ABI here.
*   `returnValueTest` **[Object][96]** An object containing three keys: "key", "comparator" and "value".  The return value of the smart contract function will be compared against these.  For example, to check if someone holds an NFT, you could use "key": "", "comparator: >" and "value: 0" which would check that a user has a token balance greater than zero.  The "key" is used when the return value is a struct which contains multiple values and should be the name of the returned value from the function abi.  You must always pass "key" when using "returnValueTest", even if you pass an empty string for it, because the function only returns a single value.

## SolRpcCondition

Type: [Object][96]

### Properties

*   `method` **[string][97]** The Solana RPC method to be called.  You can find a list here: [https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api][115]

*   `chain` **[string][97]** The chain name of the chain that this contract is deployed on.  See ALL_LIT_CHAINS for currently supported chains.  On Solana, we support "solana" for mainnet, "solanaDevnet" for devnet and "solanaTestnet" for testnet.
*   `returnValueTest` **[Object][96]** An object containing three keys: "key", "comparator" and "value".  The return value of the rpc call will be compared against these.  The "key" selector supports JSONPath syntax, so you can filter and iterate over the results.  For example, to check if someone holds an NFT with address 29G6GSKNGP8K6ATy65QrNZk4rNgsZX1sttvb5iLXWDcE, you could use "method": "GetTokenAccountsByOwner", "params": \[":userAddress",{"programId":"TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA"},{"encoding":"jsonParsed"}], "key": "$\[?(@.account.data.parsed.info.mint == "29G6GSKNGP8K6ATy65QrNZk4rNgsZX1sttvb5iLXWDcE")].account.data.parsed.info.tokenAmount.amount", "comparator: >" and "value: 0" which would check that a user has a token balance greater than zero.  The "key" is used when the return value is an array or object which contains multiple values and should be the name of the returned value or a JSONPath item.  You must always pass "key" when using "returnValueTest", even if you pass an empty string for it, because the rpc call only returns a single value.
